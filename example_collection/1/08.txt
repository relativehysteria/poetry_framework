fall

the black oaks
fling their bronze fruit
into all the pockets of the earth
  pock pock

they knock against the thresholds
the roof the sidewalk
fill the eaves
  the bottom line

of the old gold song
of the almost finished year
what is spring all that tender
  green stuff

compared to this
falling of tiny oak trees
out of the oak trees
  then the clouds

gathering thick along the west
then advancing
then closing over
  breaking open

the silence
then the rain
dashing its silver seeds
  against the house
