Death at a Great Distance

The ripe, floating caps
  of the fly amanita
    glow in the pinewoods.
      I don't even think
        of the eventual corruption of my body,

but of how quaint and humorous they are,
  like a collection of doorknobs,
    half-moons,
      then a yellow drizzle of flying saucers.
        In any case

they won't hurt me unless
  I take them between my lips
    and swallow, which I know enough
      not to do. Once, in the south,
        I had this happen:

the soft rope of a water moccasin
  slid down the red knees
    of a mangrove, the hundreds of ribs
      housed in their smooth, white
        sleeves of muscle moving it

like a happiness
  toward the water, where some bubbles
    on the surface of that underworld announced
      a fatal carelessness. I didn't
        even then move toward the fine point

of the story, but stood in my lonely body
  amazed and full of attention as it fell
    like a stream of glowing syrup into
      the dark water, as death
        blurted out of that perfectly arranged mouth.
