Morning Glories

Blue and dark blue
   rose and deepest rose
      white and pink they

are everywhere in the diligent
   cornfield rising and swaying
      in their reliable

finery in the little
   fling of their bodies their
      gear and tackle

all caught up in the cornstalks.
   The reaper's story is the story
      of endless work of

work careful and heavy but the
   reaper cannot
      separate them out there they

are in the story of his life
   bright random useless
      year after year

taken with the serious tons
   weeds without value humorous
      beautiful weeds.
