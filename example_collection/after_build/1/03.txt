forty years

for forty years
the sheets of white paper have
passed under my hands and I have tried
  to improve their peaceful

emptiness putting down
little curls little shafts
of letters words
  little flames leaping

not one page
was less to me than fascinating
discursive full of cadence
  its pale nerves hiding

in the curves of the Qs
behind the soldierly Hs
in the webbed feet of the Ws
  forty years

and again this morning as always
I am stopped as the world comes back
wet and beautiful I am thinking
  that language

is not even a river
is not a tree is not a green field
is not even a black ant traveling
  briskly modestly

from day to day from one
golden page to another
