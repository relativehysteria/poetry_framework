\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{I} go down to the edge of the sea.\verseline
How everything shines in the morning light!\verseline
The cusp of the whelk,\verseline
the broken cupboard of the clam,\verseline
the opened, blue mussels,\verseline
moon snails, pale pink and barnacle scarredâ€”\verseline
and nothing at all whole or shut, but tattered, split,\verseline
dropped by the gulls onto the gray rocks and all the moisture gone.\verseline
It's like a schoolhouse\verseline
of little words,\verseline
thousands of words.\verseline
First you figure out what each one means by itself,\verseline
the jingle, the periwinkle, the scallop full of moonlight.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Then you begin, slowly, to read the whole story.
