\poemtitle{The Real Prayers Are Not the Words,
But the Attention that Comes First}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{The} little hawk leaned sideways and, tilted,\verseline
rode the wind. Its eye at this distance looked\verseline
like green glass; its feet were the color\verseline
of butter, so was the sudden, slow circle it carved\verseline
into the slightly silvery air, and the\verseline
squaring of its shoulders, and the pulling into\verseline
itself the long, sharp-edged wings, and the\verseline
fall into the grass where it tussled a moment,\verseline
like a bundle of brown leaves, and then, again,\verseline
lifted itself into the air, that butter-color\verseline
clenched in order to hold a small, still\verseline
body, and it flew off as my mind sang out oh\verseline
all that loose, blue rink of sky, where does\verseline
it go to, and why?
\end{stanza}
