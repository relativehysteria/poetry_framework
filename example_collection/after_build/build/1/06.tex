\poemtitle{The Storm}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{Now} through the white orchard my little dog\verseline
~~roms, breaking the new snow\verseline
~~with wild feet.\verseline
Running here running there, excited,\verseline
~~hardly able to stop, he leaps, he spins\verseline
until the white snow is written upon\verseline
~~in large, exuberant letters,\verseline
a long sentence, expressing\verseline
~~the pleasures of hte body in this world.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Oh, I could not have said it better\verseline
~~myself.
\end{stanza}
