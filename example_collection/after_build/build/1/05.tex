\poemtitle{Song for Autumn}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{Don't} you imagine the leaves dream now\verseline
~~how comfortable it will be to touch\verseline
the earth instead of the\verseline
~~nothingness of the air and the endless\verseline
freshets of wind? And don't you think\verseline
~~the trees, especially those with\verseline
mossy hollows, are beginning to look for
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
the birds that will come--six, a dozen--to sleep\verseline
~~inside their bodies? And don't you hear\verseline
the goldenrod whispering goodbye,\verseline
~~the everlasting being crowned with the first\verseline
tuffets of snow? The pond\verseline
~~stiffens and the white field over which\verseline
the fox runs so quickly brings out\verseline
~~its long blue shadows. The wind wags\verseline
its many tails. And in the evening\verseline
~~the piled firewood shifts a little,\verseline
longing to be on its way.
\end{stanza}
