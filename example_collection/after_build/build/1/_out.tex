\poemtitle{White-Eyes}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{In} winter\verseline
~~~~all the singing is in\verseline
~~~~~~~~~the tops of the trees\verseline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~where the wind-bird
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
with its white eyes\verseline
~~~~shoves and pushes\verseline
~~~~~~~~~among the branches.\verseline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~Like any of us
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
he wants to go to sleep,\verseline
~~~~but he's restless--\verseline
~~~~~~~~~he has an idea,\verseline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~and slowly it unfolds
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
from under his beating wings\verseline
~~~~as long as he stays awake.\verseline
~~~~~~~~~But his big, round music, after all,\verseline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~is too breathy to last.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
So, it's over.\verseline
~~~~In the pine-crown\verseline
~~~~~~~~~he makes his nest,\verseline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~he's done all he can.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
I don't know the name of this bird,\verseline
~~~~I only imagine his glittering beak\verseline
~~~~~~~~~tucked in a white wing\verseline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~while the clouds--
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
which he has summoned\verseline
~~~~from the north--\verseline
~~~~~~~~~which he has taught\verseline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~to be mild, and silent--
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
thicken, and begin to fall\verseline
~~~~into the world below\verseline
~~~~~~~~~like stars, or the feathers\verseline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~of some unimaginable bird
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
that loves us,\verseline
~~~~that is asleep now, and silent--\verseline
~~~~~~~~~that has turned itself\verseline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~into snow.
\end{stanza}

\poemtitle{Breakage}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{I} go down to the edge of the sea.\verseline
How everything shines in the morning light!\verseline
The cusp of the whelk,\verseline
the broken cupboard of the clam,\verseline
the opened, blue mussels,\verseline
moon snails, pale pink and barnacle scarredâ€”\verseline
and nothing at all whole or shut, but tattered, split,\verseline
dropped by the gulls onto the gray rocks and all the moisture gone.\verseline
It's like a schoolhouse\verseline
of little words,\verseline
thousands of words.\verseline
First you figure out what each one means by itself,\verseline
the jingle, the periwinkle, the scallop full of moonlight.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Then you begin, slowly, to read the whole story.

\poemtitle{forty years}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{for} forty years\verseline
the sheets of white paper have\verseline
passed under my hands and I have tried\verseline
~~to improve their peaceful
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
emptiness putting down\verseline
little curls little shafts\verseline
of letters words\verseline
~~little flames leaping
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
not one page\verseline
was less to me than fascinating\verseline
discursive full of cadence\verseline
~~its pale nerves hiding
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
in the curves of the Qs\verseline
behind the soldierly Hs\verseline
in the webbed feet of the Ws\verseline
~~forty years
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
and again this morning as always\verseline
I am stopped as the world comes back\verseline
wet and beautiful I am thinking\verseline
~~that language
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
is not even a river\verseline
is not a tree is not a green field\verseline
is not even a black ant traveling\verseline
~~briskly modestly
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
from day to day from one\verseline
golden page to another

\poemtitle{The Real Prayers Are Not the Words,
But the Attention that Comes First}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{The} little hawk leaned sideways and, tilted,\verseline
rode the wind. Its eye at this distance looked\verseline
like green glass; its feet were the color\verseline
of butter, so was the sudden, slow circle it carved\verseline
into the slightly silvery air, and the\verseline
squaring of its shoulders, and the pulling into\verseline
itself the long, sharp-edged wings, and the\verseline
fall into the grass where it tussled a moment,\verseline
like a bundle of brown leaves, and then, again,\verseline
lifted itself into the air, that butter-color\verseline
clenched in order to hold a small, still\verseline
body, and it flew off as my mind sang out oh\verseline
all that loose, blue rink of sky, where does\verseline
it go to, and why?
\end{stanza}

\poemtitle{Song for Autumn}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{Don't} you imagine the leaves dream now\verseline
~~how comfortable it will be to touch\verseline
the earth instead of the\verseline
~~nothingness of the air and the endless\verseline
freshets of wind? And don't you think\verseline
~~the trees, especially those with\verseline
mossy hollows, are beginning to look for
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
the birds that will come--six, a dozen--to sleep\verseline
~~inside their bodies? And don't you hear\verseline
the goldenrod whispering goodbye,\verseline
~~the everlasting being crowned with the first\verseline
tuffets of snow? The pond\verseline
~~stiffens and the white field over which\verseline
the fox runs so quickly brings out\verseline
~~its long blue shadows. The wind wags\verseline
its many tails. And in the evening\verseline
~~the piled firewood shifts a little,\verseline
longing to be on its way.
\end{stanza}

\poemtitle{The Storm}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{Now} through the white orchard my little dog\verseline
~~roms, breaking the new snow\verseline
~~with wild feet.\verseline
Running here running there, excited,\verseline
~~hardly able to stop, he leaps, he spins\verseline
until the white snow is written upon\verseline
~~in large, exuberant letters,\verseline
a long sentence, expressing\verseline
~~the pleasures of hte body in this world.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Oh, I could not have said it better\verseline
~~myself.

\poemtitle{At Black River}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{All} day\verseline
~~its dark, slick bronze soaks\verseline
~~~~in a mossy place,\verseline
~~~~~~its teeth
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
a multitude\verseline
~~set\verseline
~~~~for the comedy\verseline
~~~~~~that never comes--
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
its tail\verseline
~~knobbed and shiny,\verseline
~~~~and with a heavy-weight's punch\verseline
~~~~~~packed around the bone.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
In beautiful Florida\verseline
~~he is king\verseline
~~~~of his own part\verseline
~~~~~~of the black river,
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
and from his nap\verseline
~~he will wake\verseline
~~~~into the warm darkness\verseline
~~~~~~to boom, and thrust forward,
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
paralyzing\verseline
~~the swift, thin-waisted fish,\verseline
~~~~or the bird\verseline
~~~~~~in its frilled, white gown,
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
that has dipped down\verseline
~~from the heaven of leaves\verseline
~~~~one last time,\verseline
~~~~~~to drink.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Don't think\verseline
~~I'm not afraid.\verseline
~~~~There is such an unleashing\verseline
~~~~~~of horror.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Then I remember:\verseline
~~death comes before\verseline
~~~~the rolling away\verseline
~~~~~~of the stone.

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{the} black oaks\verseline
fling their bronze fruit\verseline
into all the pockets of the earth\verseline
~~\textit{pock pock}

\begin{stanza}
they knock against the thresholds\verseline
the roof the sidewalk\verseline

\begin{stanza}
of the old gold song\verseline
of the almost finished year\verseline
what is spring all that tender\verseline
~~green stuff

\begin{stanza}
compared to this\verseline
falling of tiny oak trees\verseline
out of the oak trees\verseline

\begin{stanza}
gathering thick along the west\verseline
then advancing\verseline
then closing over\verseline
~~breaking open

\begin{stanza}
the silence\verseline
then the rain\verseline
dashing its silver seeds\verseline
~~against the house

\poemtitle{Death at a Great Distance}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{The} ripe, floating caps\verseline
~~of the fly amanita\verseline
~~~~glow in the pinewoods.\verseline
~~~~~~I don't even think\verseline
~~~~~~~~of the eventual corruption of my body,
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
but of how quaint and humorous they are,\verseline
~~like a collection of doorknobs,\verseline
~~~~half-moons,\verseline
~~~~~~then a yellow drizzle of flying saucers.\verseline
~~~~~~~~In any case
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
they won't hurt me unless\verseline
~~I take them between my lips\verseline
~~~~and swallow, which I know enough\verseline
~~~~~~not to do. Once, in the south,\verseline
~~~~~~~~I had this happen:
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
the soft rope of a water moccasin\verseline
~~slid down the red knees\verseline
~~~~of a mangrove, the hundreds of ribs\verseline
~~~~~~housed in their smooth, white\verseline
~~~~~~~~sleeves of muscle moving it
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
like a happiness\verseline
~~toward the water, where some bubbles\verseline
~~~~on the surface of that underworld announced\verseline
~~~~~~a fatal carelessness. I didn't\verseline
~~~~~~~~even then move toward the fine point
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
of the story, but stood in my lonely body\verseline
~~amazed and full of attention as it fell\verseline
~~~~like a stream of glowing syrup into\verseline
~~~~~~the dark water, as death\verseline
~~~~~~~~blurted out of that perfectly arranged mouth.
\end{stanza}
