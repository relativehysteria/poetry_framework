\poemtitle{forty years}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textsc{for} forty years\verseline
the sheets of white paper have\verseline
passed under my hands and I have tried\verseline
~~to improve their peaceful
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
emptiness putting down\verseline
little curls little shafts\verseline
of letters words\verseline
~~little flames leaping
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
not one page\verseline
was less to me than fascinating\verseline
discursive full of cadence\verseline
~~its pale nerves hiding
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
in the curves of the Qs\verseline
behind the soldierly Hs\verseline
in the webbed feet of the Ws\verseline
~~forty years
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
and again this morning as always\verseline
I am stopped as the world comes back\verseline
wet and beautiful I am thinking\verseline
~~that language
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
is not even a river\verseline
is not a tree is not a green field\verseline
is not even a black ant traveling\verseline
~~briskly modestly
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
from day to day from one\verseline
golden page to another
\end{stanza}
\end{poem}
