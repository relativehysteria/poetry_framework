In Malaysia

Moonlight
washes the red tiles
and the white walls

the streets
are cool at last
after the great

heat of the day
the gardeners
have all gone home

leaving the lawns
perfect
the ocean

rises
sighing
dragging its sleeves

of light and litter
along the shore
in the distance

the mountains
are smoky
old fires

greatly subdued
the brass key
is nested

in the carved door
blossoms
yellow ivory pure white

swell and begin to open
the agony of their sweetness
far older than the house

far older than the city itself
then the little bats
appear

float
over the lawns
fall

cup each flower
in their small
daggered hands.
