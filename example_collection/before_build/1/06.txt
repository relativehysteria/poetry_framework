The Storm

Now through the white orchard my little dog
  roms, breaking the new snow
  with wild feet.
Running here running there, excited,
  hardly able to stop, he leaps, he spins
until the white snow is written upon
  in large, exuberant letters,
a long sentence, expressing
  the pleasures of hte body in this world.

Oh, I could not have said it better
  myself.
